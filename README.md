Stardew Valley Iron Sheik Mod

Absolutely terrible work in progress mod to add the Iron Sheik as an NPC in Stardew Valley
Buggy, incomplete, needs proper art assets, please do not actually use for joy and entertainment at this time

Dependencies/Directions:
Requires ContentPatcher by Pathoschild
https://github.com/Pathoschild
https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400

https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915?file_id=115668&nmm=1

After installing Contentpatcher/SMAPI, simply drop the the entire Contentpatcher folder into Stardew Valley Mods folder. If running from steam, launch options will need to be set accordingly (adjust based on your local folder pathing)
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\StardewModdingAPI.exe" %command%
